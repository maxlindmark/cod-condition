## Background
The body condition and growth of Eastern Baltic cod (*Gadus morhua*) has declined steadily since the regime shift in the early 1990's to a degree that the stock now can be viewed as collapsed. Several hypotheses have been put forward, including changes in overlap with pelagic prey or lack of appropriately sized prey (e.g. Casini *et al*, 2016; Gårdmark *et al*, 2015), reduced oxygen levels decreasing habitat quality and leading to contraction of the distributional range thus increasing competition (e.g. Casini *et al*, 2016), increased competition for benthic food sources with flounder (Orio *et al*, 2019; Orio 2020) as well as increased intraspecific competition and growth bottlenecks within the population (Svedäng & Hornborg, 2014).

However, these potential explanatory variables have not been evaluated on a fine spatial scale, even though factors such as competition, food availability and local habitat quality likely occur on fine spatial scales. Instead, averages over larger spatial areas (e.g. ICES subdivisions) have been the variables in previous comparisons. Moreover, the ability of each of proposed explanatory variable (linked to a hypothesis) to explain variation in the condition of cod has not been compared in a standardized way, and has not been contrasted to residual spatial and spatiotemporal variation.

### Aim
In this study I have compiled data for individual-level condition in the whole Baltic Sea (essentially everything south and east of [Kattegatt](http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/in-brief/our-baltic-sea/)) and matched that with predictor variables (on a haul level) representing different ecological hypotheses regarding drivers of variation in cod condition.

To account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation using data at this scale, we apply spatiotemporal predictive-process GLMMs using the R-package [sdmTMB](https://github.com/pbs-assess/sdmTMB). This modeling framework allows evaluation of how much of the variation in condition can be explained by covariates, spatial (unmeasured variation in condition that is stable over time) and spatiotemporal variation (unmeasured variation in condition that changes between years).

In this script, the aim is to find a good default model explaining spatiotemporal variation in cod condition, without any of the suggested explanatory variables (the rest will be done in a different script). Then we show examples of two models with additional explanatory variable. The project currently lives [here](https://github.com/maxlindmark/cod_condition). Details follow below. 

## Methods
### Modeling framework
In fishes, weight is typically assumed to vary log-normally around an average allometric function of length: $w=al^b$, where $w$ is weight in grams, $l$ is length in cm, $b$ is the allometric length exponent and $a$ is the condition factor in unit $g/L^b$ (Froese *et al*., 2014; Grüss *et al*., 2020). Typically this relationship is linearized by taking logs on both sides: $\operatorname{log}(w)=a+b\operatorname{log}(l)$. Le Cren's condition index is defined as the residuals from this length-weight relationship.

We model this individual-level relationship with a spatiotemporal GLMM of the form (minor deviations from this model are discussed in this document):

$$
\operatorname{log}(w_{s,t}) = \alpha_t + \beta_ddepth + \boldsymbol\omega_s + \boldsymbol\epsilon_{s,t} + \sum^{n_k}_{k=1}\boldsymbol\gamma_k\boldsymbol{X_k} + \beta \operatorname{log}(l)
$$ 
<!-- SA: add the observation model; Student-t? -->

where $\alpha_t$ is a time-varying intercept:

$$
\alpha_t \sim \operatorname{Normal}(\alpha_{t-1}, \sigma^2_\gamma).
$$

$\beta_d$ is the coefficient for $depth$, $\boldsymbol\omega_s$ and $\boldsymbol\epsilon_{s,t}$ represent spatial and spatiotemporal random effects, respectively. $\boldsymbol{X_k}$ is a matrix of $n_k$ measured *additional* covariates and $\boldsymbol\gamma_k$ is the effect of the $k$-th *additional* covariate. $\beta$ is the length-coefficient, corresponding to the allometric exponent $b$. The spatial and spatiotemporal random effects are assumed to be drawn from a multivariate normal distribution:

$$
\boldsymbol\omega \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}(\boldsymbol0, \boldsymbol\Sigma_\omega)\\
\boldsymbol\epsilon_t \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}(\boldsymbol0, \boldsymbol\Sigma_\epsilon).
$$

We also consider the spatiotemporal random effects to be drawn from a multivariate normal distribution following an AR1 process:

$$
\boldsymbol\delta_{t=1} \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}(\boldsymbol0, \boldsymbol\Sigma_\epsilon)\\
\boldsymbol\delta_{t>1} = \phi\boldsymbol\delta_{t-1} + \sqrt{1-\phi^2}\boldsymbol\epsilon_t, \boldsymbol\epsilon_t \sim \operatorname{MVNormal}(\boldsymbol0, \boldsymbol\Sigma_\epsilon).
$$

In the spatial and spatiotemporal random fields, $\Sigma_\omega$ and $\Sigma_\epsilon$ are covariance matricies, where the covariance ($\Phi(s, s')$) between spatial points $s$ and $s'$ is given by a Matérn function:

$$
\Phi(s, s') = \tau^2/\Gamma(\nu)2^{\nu-1}(\kappa d_{jk})^{\nu}K_\nu(\kappa d_{jk}),
$$
where $\tau^2$ is the spatial (marginal) variance. 

This model (first equation) can be viewed as an approximation of Le Cren's condition index (Grüss *et al*., 2020), as the log of the condition factor, i.e. $\operatorname{log}(a)$ or the constant in the allometric relationship, can be defined as: $\operatorname{log}(a) = \alpha_t + \boldsymbol\omega_s + \boldsymbol\epsilon_{s,t} + \sum^{n_k}_{k=1}\boldsymbol\gamma_k\boldsymbol{X_k}$. Thus, Eq. 1 is a model for a spatially and temporally varying condition factor.

### Finding a default model
The basic model structure above was determined after exploring different options, including different distributions, different degrees of freedom in the Student-t distribution, spatial trends, year as factor effects and # of knots (not shown here), and also based on the ecological question. For instance, depth is included to test if density variables have interactive effects with depth, which to extent is a proxy for benthic production (more on that in the model comparison script!). We no longer include sex as a covariate, and this is mainly because the predicted difference between males and females is very small (difference in the third decimal), and that un-sexed individuals are not in between the two estimates as would be expected but smaller. 

Therefore, in this script we will mostly focus on different ways to model temporal changes (time varying intercept, year as factor or spatial trends), as well as comparing the support for autoregressive vs independent spatiotemporal fields and the inclusion of depth and how that affects other components of the model (mainly oxygen and spatial random fields).

After that we proceed with a final model and exemplify how models with additional covariates that are hypothesized to drive variation in the condition factor can be fitted.

### Data
#### Individual length and weight
The data are individual-level measurements of length and weight of Baltic cod in quarter 4 between the year 1991-2019, and stem from the Baltic International Trawl Survey (BITS) (can be downloaded from [DATRAS](https://datras.ices.dk/Data_products/Download/Download_Data_public.aspx)). These data are cleaned and merged with additional covariate data in [this](https://github.com/maxlindmark/cod_condition/blob/master/R/clean_data/clean_bits.R) script.

#### Haul-level covariates
The covariates we currently consider are (see repo readme for sources):

* **CPUE of cod**: Abundance CPUE by length group, currently >30cm, ≤30 cm or total
* **CPUE of flounder**: Abundance CPUE by length group, currently >20cm, ≤20 cm or total
* **Oxygen concentration**: NEMO-Nordic-SCOBI model output
* **Abundance of sprat**: Abundance CPUE by age (currently all pooled) per ICES rectangle
* **Abundance of herring**: Abundance CPUE by age (currently all pooled) per ICES rectangle
* **Maybe**: Temperature as a base-covariate through its effect on growth, metabolism, digestion etc.

The covariates are standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, to allow for direct comparison with the spatial and spatiotemporal standard deviation, following Thorson (2015) and Grüss *et al* (2020).

### Explore data

```{r packages, message=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
library(tidyverse); theme_set(theme_classic())
library(tidylog)
library(viridis)
library(sdmTMB) # remotes::install_github("pbs-assess/sdmTMB")
library(marmap)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(rnaturalearthdata)
library(sf)
library(gganimate)
library(gifski)
library(png)
library(qwraps2) # To load entire cache in interactive r session, do: qwraps2::lazyload_cache_dir(path = "R/explore/default_models_cache/html")

# For adding maps to plots
world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")

# Specify map ranges
ymin = 54; ymax = 58; xmin = 9.5; xmax = 22
```

Now read data:

```{r read and process data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
d <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlindmark/cod_condition/master/data/for_analysis/mdat_cond.csv")

d$year <- as.integer(d$year)
```

Read the prediction grids:

```{r read and process prediction grid, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pred_grid <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlindmark/cod_condition/master/data/for_analysis/pred_grid.csv")

pred_grid <- pred_grid %>%
  mutate(ln_length_cm = log(1)) %>% # For now we'll predict changes in the intercept ("condition factor")
  mutate(X = lon,
         Y = lat,
         year = as.integer(year),
         depth_st = 0) %>% # In this prediction grid I keep depth at its mean, below I have a more realistic prediction grid
  filter(year %in% c(unique(d$year)))

# And now read in pred_grid2 which has oxygen values at location and time and depth:
pred_grid2 <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxlindmark/cod_condition/master/data/for_analysis/pred_grid2.csv")

pred_grid2 <- pred_grid2 %>%
  mutate(ln_length_cm = log(1)) %>% # For now we'll predict changes in the intercept ("condition factor")
  mutate(X = lon, Y = lat, year = as.integer(year)) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(unique(d$year))) %>% 
  mutate(depth_st = depth,
         oxy_st = oxy) %>% 
  mutate_at(c("depth_st", "oxy_st"),
            ~(scale(.) %>% as.vector))
```

We can now plot the Fulton K condition factor to get a glimpse of what we might expect (but in the main model we use Le Cren's condition index).

```{r plot condition, fig.width=12}
# Plot "Fulton K" in space and time 
# It's a little bit difficult to see because we have many extreme observations
ggplot(d, aes(Fulton_K)) + geom_histogram()

# Plot "Fulton K" in space and time 
d %>% 
  filter(Fulton_K < 2) %>% # remove the extremes for now
  ggplot(., aes(lon, lat, color = Fulton_K)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_color_gradient2(midpoint = mean(d$Fulton_K)) +
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax))
```

There is a clear temporal development in condition and the spatial coverage of data varies by year (fewer data in the beginning of the time series).

## Find the default model
### Define spde mesh
In earlier versions we used this: `spde <- make_mesh(data = d, xy_cols = c("lon", "lat"), n_knots = 110, type = "kmeans", seed = 42)`. But now we have even more islands in the data since I am using also the western Baltic Sea, so we will use the `add_barrier_mesh` to include an island effect (following the example function). Note this also means we can increase the # of knots before hitting convergence issues (how much varies from model to model though!)

```{r make barrier spde mesh, results='hide', cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# Crop the polygon for plotting and efficiency:
baltic_coast <- suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(
  st_crop(world,
          c(xmin = xmin, ymin = ymin, xmax = xmax, ymax = ymax))))

crs <- 4326 # https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPSG_Geodetic_Parameter_Dataset#Common_EPSG_codes, WGS84

st_crs(baltic_coast) <- 4326 # 'WGS84'; necessary on some installs
baltic_coast <- st_transform(baltic_coast, crs)

# Project our survey data coordinates:
survey <- d %>% dplyr::select(lon, lat, ln_weight_g) %>%
  st_as_sf(crs = 4326, coords = c("lon", "lat")) 

# Plot our coast and survey data:
ggplot(baltic_coast) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = survey, size = 0.5)

# Prepare for making the mesh
# First, we will extract the coordinates:
surv_coords <- st_coordinates(survey)

spde <- make_mesh(d, xy_cols = c("lon", "lat"),
                  n_knots = 200, type = "kmeans", seed = 42)
plot(spde)

# Add on the barrier mesh component:
bspde <- add_barrier_mesh(
  spde, baltic_coast, range_fraction = 0.2,
  proj_scaling = 1, plot = TRUE
)

# In the above, the grey dots are the centre of triangles that are in the
# ocean. The red crosses are centres of triangles that are over land. The
# spatial range will be assumed to be 0.2 (`range_fraction`) over land compared
# to over water.

# We can make a more advanced plot if we want:
mesh_df_water <- bspde$mesh_sf[bspde$normal_triangles, ]
mesh_df_land <- bspde$mesh_sf[bspde$barrier_triangles, ]
ggplot(baltic_coast) +
  geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = mesh_df_water, size = 1, colour = "blue") +
  geom_sf(data = mesh_df_land, size = 1, colour = "green")

# Now, when we fit our model with the new mesh, it will automatically
# include a barrier structure in the spatial correlation:
```

### Fit models with different ways of accounting for temporal changes

```{r fit first model, cache=TRUE}
m1 <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + -1, time_varying = ~1, data = d, time = "year",
             spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = FALSE,
             include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
             silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = TRUE)
```

We can also consider the following models, with a spatial trend (to capture the larger decline in condition in the western Baltic), or the simple approach with a year factor instead of a random walk.

```{r potential models, cache=TRUE}
# extra: spatial trends
m_trends <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + -1, data = d, time = "year",
                    spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = FALSE,
                    include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = TRUE, spatial_only = FALSE,
                    silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = TRUE)

# extra: factor year
m_year <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + factor(year) -1, data = d, time = "year",
                 spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = FALSE,
                 include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
                 silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = TRUE)
```

We will compare the fixed year effect further down with the random walk estimates, and here we will just show the spatial trend prediction: 

```{r plot spatial trends on grid, fig.width=12, message=FALSE}
p_trends <- predict(m_trends, newdata = pred_grid)

# Replace too-deep predictions with NA
p_trends <- p_trends %>% mutate(zeta_s2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, zeta_s)) # spatial trend

ggplot(filter(p_trends, year == 2000), aes(lon, lat, fill = zeta_s2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Spatial trends")
```

This plot shows that there are some east-west spatial differences in the change in condition. Despite this spatial trend, we will here proceed with the random walk on intercepts models.

### Fit models with independent or autoregressive spatiotemporal field

```{r AR1, cache=TRUE}
# Model 1 with AR1 spatiotemporal random fields
m2 <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + -1, time_varying = ~1, data = d, time = "year",
             spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = TRUE,
             include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
             silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = TRUE)
```

Look at the residuals:
```{r extract residuals}
df <- d

df$residuals_m1 <- residuals(m1)
df$residuals_m2 <- residuals(m2)

qqnorm(df$residuals_m1); abline(a = 0, b = 1)
qqnorm(df$residuals_m2); abline(a = 0, b = 1)

# They look *very* similar, plot against each other
plot(df$residuals_m1 ~ df$residuals_m2)
```

We can also check the AR1 parameter

<!-- SA: the plogis stuff isn't needed now that I've fixed the argument to `conf.int` (not my choice to add the dot! The choice of the broom package.) -->

```{r check AR1 estimate}
tidy(m2, effects = "ran_pars", conf.int = TRUE)
# Transform back to -1 to 1 scale
2 * plogis(tidy(m2, effects = "ran_pars", confint = TRUE)$estimate[5]) - 1
2 * plogis(tidy(m2, effects = "ran_pars", confint = TRUE)$estimate[5] + c(-2, 2) * tidy(m2, effects = "ran_pars", conf.int = TRUE)$std.error[5]) - 1
```

The AR1 estimate is quite large and its confidence interval does not overlap 0, which indicates we should keep it like that (FYI when we set `spatial_trend = TRUE`, the AR1 correlation parameter becomes very small!). We can also Compare their AICs:

<!-- SA: Yes, most likely one or the other -->

```{r extract student aic}
AIC(m1)
AIC(m2)
```

We will continue with the AR1 spatiotemporal fields. Plot the residuals also against predictions and then over length:

```{r residuals vs fitted and x}
pred_m2 <- predict(m2)
df$pred_m2 <- pred_m2$est

qqnorm(df$residuals_m2); abline(a = 0, b = 1)

ggplot(df, aes(pred_m2, residuals_m2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "grey20") + 
  geom_abline(color = "red", slope = 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_smooth()

ggplot(df, aes(ln_length_cm, residuals_m2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "grey20") + 
  geom_abline(color = "red", slope = 0, linetype = 2) +
  geom_smooth()
```

They look a little bit funny at small lengths (and small predicted weights), and overall there seems to be a peak in the middle of the predicted data (and ln_length_cm). I think that is because a) the small ones are quite rare and b) data are in cm size-classes (a bit coarse for a ~5 cm fish, hence many are assigned the same length). I do not have a good feeling for why there would be a peak in the relationship though.

<!-- SA: Yeah, agreed. Also try adding `alpha = something` and maybe add a `geom_smooth`-->

Check the residuals on a map:

```{r residuals on map, fig.width=12}
ggplot(df, aes(lon, lat, colour = residuals_m2)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_color_gradient2()
```

Maybe some clustering remains... But overall OK I think!

Now that we have random structure, I will refit it with `reml=FALSE`, because from now on we will only change and compare models with different fixed effects. For the base model, we can consider depth. Depth is an interesting variable, because in the eastern Baltic sea where we have a stronger decline in condition, it is also deeper. Deep areas are generally low in oxygen, but also shallow areas can be that. However, in the eastern Baltic sea, there are no benthic prey for cod besides *Saduria entomon*, and they do not occupy deep areas (Gogina *et al.*, 2020). and because saduria no not live in the western Baltic sea, we could not include that as a variable directly but would instead have to use a proxy for many different benthic species. Hence, depth can in the whole study area be seen as a proxy for availability of benthic food. It also means that we can see later if there are interactions between density of cod and/or flounder and depth, indicating that the degree of competition changes over a depth gradient. First, plot the relationship between oxygen and depth, to make sure they are not too correlated:

```{r depth vs oxygen, cache=TRUE}
ggplot(d, aes(depth_st, oxy_st)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  annotate("text", label = paste("correlation coefficient = ", round(cor(d$oxy_st, d$depth_st), digits = 2), sep = ""), x = -Inf, y = -Inf, hjust = -0.1, vjust = -1)  
```

Now refit the default model with `reml=FALSE`:
```{r def model with ML, cache=TRUE}
# Model 2 with ML
mdef <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm -1, time_varying = ~1, data = d, time = "year",
               spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = TRUE,
               include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
               silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = FALSE)
```

And compare that with a model with depth as a covariate:

```{r def model + depth with ML, cache=TRUE}
# Model 2 with ML
mdef2 <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + depth_st -1, time_varying = ~1, data = d, time = "year",
                spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = TRUE,
                include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
                silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = FALSE)
```

Compare the models using AIC:
```{r AIC depth or not, cache=TRUE}
AIC(mdef, mdef2)
```

### Plot predictions
Now we can predict and plot estimates using all fixed and random effects on pre-made grid. This grid is created by doing an `expand.grid` over the survey range, then filtering out areas that are actually in the ocean using ICES shapefiles. Lastly some areas are too deep for sampling (-135 m). There is a depth column in the prediction grad and we can make those predictions NA so it is clear they are different from e.g. land and islands (and so that the color gradient is not going too far because of the extreme predictions at these depths).

```{r predict on grid, message=FALSE}
p <- predict(mdef2, newdata = pred_grid)

# Replace too-deep predictions with NA
p <- p %>% mutate(est2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, est), # prediction (fixed + random)
                  eps_st2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, epsilon_st), # spatiotemporal effects
                  omega_s2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, omega_s), # spatial random effect
                  est_non_rf2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, est_non_rf)) # spatial trend
```

Plot the predicted condition with fixed and random effects:

```{r plot prediciton on grid, fig.width=12}
ggplot(p, aes(lon, lat, fill = est2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", 
                     name = "log(condition factor)") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) + 
  ggtitle("Prediction (random + fixed)")
```

Plot the spatiotemporal random effects:

```{r plot spatiotemporal on grid, fig.width=12, message=FALSE}
ggplot(p, aes(lon, lat, fill = eps_st2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(name = "eps_st") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Spatiotemporal random effects")
```

Plot the spatial random effects:

```{r plot spatial on grid, fig.width=12}
ggplot(filter(p, year == 2000), aes(lon, lat, fill = omega_s2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(name = "omega_s") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Spatial random effects")
```
The spatial random field seems to largely follow depth (except in the most western part which is shallow but relatively low oxygen), which makes sense since it is constant across years and reflects e.g. oxygen concentration and overall habitat quality (deep areas are even anoxic).

Lastly, we can extract and plot the annual estimates, and compare them with the model where year is a factor (note that one is fitted with restricted maximum likelihood whereas the default model is now fitted with maximum likelihood):

```{r additional models,cache=TRUE,message=FALSE}
# Fit m1 with reml=FALSE
m_yearb <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + depth_st + factor(year) -1, data = d, time = "year",
                  spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2), ar1_fields = FALSE,
                  include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
                  silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = FALSE)

# In the factor models, these are fixed effects and can be extracted with the tidy-function.
m_year_fixed <- tidy(m_yearb, effects = "fixed", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!term %in% c("ln_length_cm", "depth_st")) %>% 
  mutate(Model = "Factor year",
         Year = unique(m_yearb$data$year))

# For the random walk model annual intercepts are extract from the sd_report object
m_rw <- m_year_fixed
m_rw <- m_rw %>%

The random walk model estimates slightly higher and less variable condition, and there seems to be a kind of plateau starting in 2004 following a more steep annual decline.

<!-- SA: is it actually generally high? I see it higher and lower. This is very cool though. -->

Now we want to refit the same model with two of the additional fixed effects outlined above, to exemplify the suggested approach.

## Add covariates to default model
Here is an example of how the importance of additional covariates can be evaluated. To keep it simple we use one oxygen, modelled as a linear effect and with a spline because there might be a threshold effect of it on condition. The rest of this analysis (i.e. with all covariates) will be done in different rmarkdown file. 

```{r spatiotemporal glmm with covariates, cache=TRUE}
# Fit model with oxygen concentration as covariate
moxy <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + depth_st + oxy_st -1, time_varying = ~1,
               data = d, time = "year", spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2),
               ar1_fields = TRUE, include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
               silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = FALSE)

# And one with oxygen modeled as a spline 
moxy_gam <- sdmTMB(formula = ln_weight_g ~ ln_length_cm + depth_st + s(oxy_st, k = 3) -1, time_varying = ~1,
                   data = d, time = "year", spde = bspde, family = student(link = "identity", df = 2),
                   ar1_fields = TRUE, include_spatial = TRUE, spatial_trend = FALSE, spatial_only = FALSE,
                   silent = TRUE, newton_steps = 1, reml = FALSE)

# Check the models
print(moxy)
print(moxy_gam)
```

Check the new fixed effect estimates and their confidence interval:

```{r check new fixed effects}
tidy(moxy, conf.int = TRUE)
tidy(moxy_gam, conf.int = TRUE)
```

Plot marginal effects:
 
```{r marginal effects, fig.width=12, cache=TRUE}
# Prepare prediction data frame
nd_oxy <- data.frame(oxy_st = seq(min(d$oxy_st), max(d$oxy_st), length.out = 100))
nd_oxy$year <- 2003L
nd_oxy$depth_st <- 0
nd_oxy$ln_length_cm <- 0

# Predict from linear oxygen model
p_margin_oxy <- predict(moxy, newdata = nd_oxy, se_fit = TRUE, re_form = NA)

# Predict from spline model
p_margin_oxy_gam <- predict(moxy_gam, newdata = nd_oxy, se_fit = TRUE, re_form = NA)

# Plot together:
oxy_preds <- bind_rows(mutate(p_margin_oxy, model = "linear"),
                       mutate(p_margin_oxy_gam, model = "gam"))

ggplot(oxy_preds, aes(oxy_st, est,
  ymin = est - 1.96 * est_se, ymax = est + 1.96 * est_se, fill = model, color = model)) +
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.4) + geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 0.9))
```

Does not look like a very strong support for a spline here. We can also compare their AICs:

```{r model comparison with AIC}
AIC(mdef2)
AIC(moxy)
AIC(moxy_gam)
```

Now look more closely at the our estimates, specifically comparing the standard deviation of spatial and spatiotemporal variation with our coefficients for the standardized variables:

```{r extract sds of random fields, message=FALSE}
# Extract random and fixed coefficients from the oxygen model, bind rows
moxy_est <- bind_rows(tidy(moxy, effects = "ran_par", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
                        filter(term %in% c("sigma_O", "sigma_E")),
                      tidy(moxy, effects = "fixed", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
                        filter(term %in% c("oxy_st", "depth_st"))) %>% 
  mutate(model = "oxygen model\n(AIC selected)")

# ... And the default model
mdef2_est <- bind_rows(tidy(mdef2, effects = "ran_par", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
                        filter(term %in% c("sigma_O", "sigma_E")),
                      tidy(mdef2, effects = "fixed", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
                        filter(term %in% c("depth_st"))) %>% 
  mutate(model = "default model")

# ... And the default model without depth
mdef_est <- tidy(mdef, effects = "ran_par", conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(term %in% c("sigma_O", "sigma_E")) %>% 
  mutate(model = "default model no depth")

coef_df <- bind_rows(moxy_est, mdef2_est, mdef_est) 
dodge <- position_dodge(width = 0.3)

ggplot(coef_df, aes(term, estimate, color = model, group = model)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, position = dodge) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), position = dodge, width = 0.2) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2") + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2, color = "gray") +
  ggtitle("Spatial and spatiotemporal variation vs covariates")
```

I interpret this as follows: The effect of oxygen is stronger now than in previous versions, and the magnitude is alrger than that of spatial and spatiotemporal variation (mainly because we know use model-predicted oxygen instead of the nearest observed oxygen in-situ concentration which was inaccurate). Inclusion of the depth variable reduces the standard deviation of the spatial random field, and to a smaller degree also the spatiotemporal standard deviation. Including oxygen reduces the effect of depth (which at least partly is due to deep areas being low in oxygen).

For the sake of comparison, I can also produce a map to look at the differences there. Here I am using the oxygen model.

```{r map prediction for covariate model, message=FALSE, fig.width=12}
# Add in a fixed covariate here
pred_grid_oxy <- pred_grid
pred_grid_oxy$oxy_st <- 0 # Mean since standardized

poxy <- predict(moxy, newdata = pred_grid_oxy)

# Replace too-deep predictions with NA
poxy <- poxy %>% mutate(est2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, est))

ggplot(poxy, aes(X, Y, fill = est2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", 
                     name = "log(condition factor)") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Prediction (random + fixed) with oxygen model at mean oxygen") +
  labs(x = "lon", y = "lat")
```

And here is a map with the ratio between oxygen and the default model:

```{r map ratio of predictions, message=FALSE, fig.width=12}
poxy$est_ratio <- poxy$est2 / p$est2

ggplot(poxy, aes(X, Y, fill = est_ratio)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~ year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = 1) + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Ratio of prediction (random + fixed) oxygen:default") +
  labs(x = "lon", y = "lat")
```

Not surprisingly perhaps, the model predictions differ mostly in areas with low oxygen concentration (although the difference is small!). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%"}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/maxlindmark/Desktop/R_STUDIO_PROJECTS/cod_condition/figures/supp/oxygen_rasters/2005.png")
```
Lastly, we can make a prediction over a grid with modeled oxygen and estimated depth values (i.e. the Baltic...):

```{r predict on grid with oxygen, message=FALSE, fig.width=12}
# Add in a fixed covariate here
poxy2 <- predict(moxy, newdata = pred_grid2)

# Replace too-deep predictions with NA
poxy2 <- poxy2 %>% mutate(est2 = ifelse(depth > 120, NA, est))

ggplot(poxy2, aes(X, Y, fill = est2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", 
                     name = "log(condition factor)") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Prediction (random + fixed)") +
  labs(x = "lon", y = "lat")
```

And here is a map with the ratio between oxygen and the default model:

```{r map ratio of predictions with oxygen, message=FALSE, fig.width=12}
p_no_na <- p
p_no_na$id <- paste(p_no_na$lat, p_no_na$lon, p_no_na$year) # some oxygen values with NA hence I need to make sure I have the same coordinates
poxy2$id <- paste(poxy2$lat, poxy2$lon, poxy2$year)

# Filter id's so they are the same
p_no_na <- p_no_na %>% filter(id %in% poxy2$id)

# Calculate ratio
poxy2$est_ratio <- poxy2$est2 / p_no_na$est2

ggplot(poxy2, aes(X, Y, fill = est_ratio)) +
  geom_raster() +
  facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 5) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(midpoint = 1) + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  ggtitle("Prediction (random + fixed) with covariates oxygen model at modelled oxygen") +
  labs(x = "lon", y = "lat")
```

```{r gganimate condition, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(poxy2, aes(X, Y, fill = est2)) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "magma", 
                     name = "log(condition factor)") + 
  geom_sf(data = world, inherit.aes = F, size = 0.2) +
  coord_sf(xlim = c(xmin, xmax), ylim = c(ymin, ymax)) +
  labs(x = "lon", y = "lat")

# Here comes the gganimate specific bits
anim <- p +
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}') +
  transition_time(as.integer(year)) +
  ease_aes('linear') +
  theme_classic(base_size = 24)

gganimate::animate(anim, height = 1200, width = 1200)

anim_save(filename = "/Users/maxlindmark/Desktop/R_STUDIO_PROJECTS/cod_condition/output/gif/cond_oxy.gif")  
```

Again, the story seems to be that condition is getting worse throughout the Baltic Sea and it's already worse in deep area (see bathymetry map below), and maybe the time trend is also slightly stronger there!

```{r, message=FALSE}
# All defaults
pred_grid2 %>% 
  filter(year == 1999) %>% 
  filter(depth > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(lon, lat, fill = depth)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = rev(terrain.colors(10)),
                         limits = c(min(drop_na(pred_grid2)$depth),
                                    max(drop_na(pred_grid2)$depth))) +
  geom_raster()
```
